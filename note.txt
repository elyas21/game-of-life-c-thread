There are two type of shared memory  machines
1 symetric multia process
  every processor element have equal fitting as far as oprating system.
  it assume no special memory block of meomory, all memorys are equaly acesseble on same cost from anywary from the machine.

2, Non Nniform Address Space Multiprocessor(NUMA)
  different region hase different acess cost.




Race Conditon:
when the program outcomes change when they schedule differently

forkJoin model:
master thread had ID 0;

  program start as single thread
  when parallazim is need it create block of thread (team of threads);
when they finish thire work they join back to master thread;
  we can nest thread;
